# COVID-19 Research Dataset Analysis

This project aims to perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the **CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset)**, which contains scientific articles related to COVID-19. The project investigates important trends within the dataset, such as the temporal distribution of articles, publication sources, licenses, and the journals in which they were published.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)**. This dataset is a comprehensive resource that includes scientific publications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It contains various metadata such as article titles, abstracts, authors, publication dates, and journal information.

You can access the dataset directly from Kaggle: [CORD-19 Research Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

## Project Objectives

* To load and perform an initial inspection of the CORD-19 dataset.
* To clean and organize missing and inconsistent data within the dataset.
* To analyze the distribution of publication sources and licenses.
* To identify the top journals with the most publications.
* To visualize the monthly publication trends over time.
* To derive basic insights from the dataset and support them with visualizations.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis and manipulation.
* **Pandas:** A library used for working with dataframes.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Libraries used for creating data visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The environment where the project was interactively developed and presented.

## Analysis Results

The project provides insights into various aspects of the CORD-19 dataset, including:

* **Distribution of Publication Sources (source_x):** This analysis reveals that the majority of articles originate from major scientific repositories, with the WHO being a significant contributor.
* **Distribution of Publication Licenses:** This section highlights the common license types, including a notable number of 'unk' (unknown) licenses, indicating the variability in licensing information within the dataset.
* **Top 10 Journals by Number of Publications:** Identifies the leading journals like PLoS One, bioRxiv, and International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, underscoring their role in disseminating COVID-19 research.
* **Monthly Publication Trends Since 2019:** This visualization illustrates the evolution of research output, showing a clear surge in publications starting in early 2020, which aligns with the global spread of the pandemic.
